 
# Verilog Code for UART Module


## Inputs

- `clk_tx`: clock signal for the transmit part of the UART
- `clk_rx`: clock signal for the receive part of the UART
- `rst_tx`: reset signal for the transmit part of the UART
- `rst_rx`: reset signal for the receive part of the UART
- `data_tx`: data to be transmitted
- `ready_tx`: signal indicating that the transmit buffer is ready to accept data
- `write_tx`: signal indicating that data is ready to be transmitted

## Outputs

- `ready_rx`: signal indicating that the receive buffer has data ready to be read
- `data_rx`: data received by the UART

The module instantiates two sub-modules: `Tx_Uart` and `Rx_Uart`. 

The `Tx_Uart` sub-module takes in the inputs `clk_tx`, `rst_tx`, `data_tx`, `ready_tx`, and `write_tx`, and outputs the signal `data_line`. It is responsible for transmitting data on the UART interface.

The `Rx_Uart` sub-module takes in the inputs `clk_rx`, `rst_rx`, `data_line`, and outputs `ready_rx` and `data_rx`. It is responsible for receiving data on the UART interface.

Overall, this module provides an interface for transmitting and receiving data using the UART protocol.


# Verilog Code for UART Transmitter Module


## Inputs and Outputs

The module takes in several inputs:
- `clk`: clock signal
- `rst`: reset signal
- `data`: data to be transmitted
- `ready`: receiver ready signal
- `write`: transmitter write signal

It generates an output signal, `Tx`, which is the transmitted serial data.

## Internal Signals

The module has several internal signals, including:
- `state`: current state of the module, which can be idle, start, data_transfer, or stop
- `counter`: number of bits being transmitted
- `RTS`: receiver ready to receive data
- `RTW`: transmitter ready to write data

## State Machine

The module operates using a state machine. At the beginning, when the reset signal (`rst`) is high, the output `Tx` is set to high and the state and counter signals are set to 0. The `RTW` and `RTS` signals are also set to 0.

In the "idle" state, the module waits for the receiver to be ready to receive data (`ready_rx`) and for the transmitter to write data (`write_tx`). When both signals are high, the module sets the `RTW` signal to high and saves the data to the buffer. If the receiver is ready to receive data (`ready_rx`) and the buffer has data, the module sets the `RTS` signal to high and changes to the "start" state.

In the "start" state, the module sets the `Tx` output signal to low and changes to the "data_transfer" state.

In the "data_transfer" state, the module starts transmitting the data from the buffer in a serial format. It shifts the data from the buffer to the `Tx` output signal, one bit at a time, and increments the counter for each bit transmitted. If the counter reaches the maximum value, the module changes to the "stop" state.

In the "stop" state, the module sets the `Tx` output signal to high and changes back to the "idle" state.

Overall, this module represents the transmitter part of the UART system and implements the functionality of transmitting data asynchronously.

# Verilog Code for UART receiver Module

The Rx_Uart module is responsible for receiving the serial data and converting it back to parallel form. It has four inputs and two outputs:

### Inputs:
- `clk`: clock signal
- `rst`: reset signal
- `Rx`: input serial data line
- `ready`: ready signal indicating when the data is ready to be read by the receiver.

### Outputs:
- `data_out`: 8-bit parallel data output
- `ready`: output signal indicating when the data is ready to be read by the receiver.

The module has three internal signals:
- `buffer`: 8-bit buffer to store the received serial data.
- `state`: 2-bit state machine to keep track of the current state.
- `counter`: 3-bit counter to keep track of the number of bits received.

The Rx_Uart module operates in two states:

1. **Idle state (idle):** This is the initial state of the module. In this state, the ready output is set to 0 and the module waits for the start bit to arrive. When the start bit arrives (`Rx` input becomes 0), the module transitions to the receive_data state.

2. **Receive data state (receive_data):** In this state, the module receives the serial data and stores it in the buffer. The counter variable is used to keep track of the number of bits received. When the counter reaches 8, all the data bits are received and the ready output is set to 1 to indicate that the data is ready to be read. After that, the module transitions back to the idle state.

The Rx_Uart module uses a synchronous process with the `clk` signal. When the `rst` signal is asserted, the module resets its internal state and the buffer is set to 0. In the receive_data state, the `Rx` input is sampled on the rising edge of the clock signal, and the counter is incremented. When all the 8 bits are received, the `data_out` output is assigned to the buffer. The `ready` output is also set to 1 to indicate that the data is ready to be read.
